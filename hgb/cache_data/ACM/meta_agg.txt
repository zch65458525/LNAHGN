Here is the formatted explanation of the metapaths with their practical meanings and importance scores for the node type classification task in the ACM dataset:

---

<metapath>  
<name>P</name>

### Summary of Key Metapaths:
- **High importance (0.7–0.85)**: `PC`, `PCP`, `PCPC`, `PAP`, `PCPA` (conference and authorship signals dominate).  
- **Moderate importance (0.5–0.7)**: `PPC`, `PAPC`, `PPCPC`, `PPAPC` (mixed or indirect signals).  
- **Low importance (<0.5)**: `PPPPP`, `PPPPA`, `PPPAP` (overly complex or noisy).  

The scores reflect the **trade-off between relevance and noise**: shorter metapaths with clear semantic meanings (e.g., `PC`, `PAP`) are generally more reliable, while longer metapaths often introduce redundancy or noise.
