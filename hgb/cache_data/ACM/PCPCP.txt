The central paper focuses on disease classification using random forests and SVMs, while its 4-hop neighborhood (PCPCP) includes works on RFID data cleaning (SMURF), location prediction (WhereNext), relational data mining validation, tree-based indexing, CAD similarity search, dynamic data warehousing (EVE), XML semantic search (XSearch), BPEL querying (BP-QL), shared filter optimization, polynomial association rules, matrix/tensor sampling, correlation analysis, optical database architecture (Datacycle), approximate membership filtering, and distributed sensor querying—spanning data mining and database domains with techniques for efficient querying, pattern discovery, and data analysis.
The central paper introduces AV for OLTP-OLAP integration, while neighbors cover topics like collaborative crawling, pattern compression, DPhyp algorithm, QoX-driven ETL, incremental view updates, probabilistic event processing, sequence query extensions, out-of-core mining, improved collaborative filtering, social network evolution, fraud detection, HMM-integrated rule mining, moving object tracking, and multimedia retrieval—all intersecting with data mining or database domains.
