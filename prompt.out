In a heterogeneous graph neural network using the ACM dataset, there are three types of nodes: Paper (P), Author (A), and Subject (S). 
The goal is to classify the node types of paper nodes. Using the metapath approach, the following metapaths are constructed: PA, PS, PAP, PSP, PAPAP, PSPSP.
Below is an explanation of the practical meanings of these metapaths and their importance scores (a value between 0 and 1) for the node type classification task.
Each metapath should be in this format:
<metapath>
<name>metapath's name</name>
<meaning>metapath's meaning</meaning>
<score>importance score</score>
<reason>reason for the importance score</reason>
</metapath>
